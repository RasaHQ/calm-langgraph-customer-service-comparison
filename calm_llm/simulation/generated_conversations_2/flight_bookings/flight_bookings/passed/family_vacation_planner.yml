  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user, a family vacation planner, approached
    the bot with the intention to change flights for an entire family due to a change
    in holiday plans. The bot was able to identify the family''s group booking and
    provide the information to the user. However, the conversation ended before the
    bot could offer rescheduling options for the flights. Thus, the user''s objective
    was only partially met.'
