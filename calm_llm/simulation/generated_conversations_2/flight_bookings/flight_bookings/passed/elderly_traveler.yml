  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The elderly user wanted to modify an existing
    flight booking to include a travel companion. Despite some initial difficulties
    in providing the required details, the bot patiently retrieved the correct flight
    information and presented the user with alternative flight options. However, the
    conversation does not confirm if the user''s objective was fully met, as it does
    not show the user finalizing their choice.'
