  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user, a business traveler with a layover
    in Paris, asked the bot for city excursion recommendations. While the bot did
    suggest some options, it circumvented the user''s specific question about the
    duration and start time of the quick city tour, repeating a pre-programmed response
    instead. The user''s objective of confirming if the tour fits within their layover
    time was not met.'
