  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user, a business traveler, wanted to
    reschedule their flight from New York to San Francisco. The bot provided multiple
    flight options for the user''s preferred departure date. The user initially gave
    an incorrect flight number, but the bot was able to find the correct flights and
    offered the user several options to reschedule the flight. However, the bot repeated
    the same line when the user requested for a different date which makes it unclear
    whether the user''s objectives were met.'
