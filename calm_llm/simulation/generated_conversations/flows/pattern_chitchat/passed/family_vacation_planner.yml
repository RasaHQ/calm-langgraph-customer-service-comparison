  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user''s objective was to book a hotel
    room and a day excursion for her family''s upcoming vacation. The user successfully
    booked a hotel room in Zurich after initially wanting to book in Miami. The bot,
    however, provided no hotel information for Miami. When the user wanted to book
    a day excursion, they changed their mind midway to booking a rental car instead.
    The bot responded according to the change, and thus, the user was partially successful
    in fulfilling her objective.'
