  rating: 1.0
  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user''s objective was to book a family-friendly
    hotel and rent a car for a family vacation, but the bot failed to assist effectively
    and repeated the same message about unavailable hotel information in Miami despite
    the user already choosing another suggested location (Geneva). The user''s request
    for car rental was acknowledged but not fulfilled by the bot.'
