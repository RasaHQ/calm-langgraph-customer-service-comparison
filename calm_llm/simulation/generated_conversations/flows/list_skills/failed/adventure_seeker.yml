  rating: 2.0
  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user requested information about day
    excursions in New York and decided to book the Statue of Liberty tour. However,
    the bot failed to ask for necessary details like the date of the excursion and
    the number of people going, leading to confusion and repetition in the conversation.
    The bot seems to have prematurely booked the tour without confirming these details.
    The user''s objective was not completely met due to the bot''s failure to gather
    necessary information for the booking.'
