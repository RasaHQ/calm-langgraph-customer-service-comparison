  rating_reasoning: 'Conversation summary: The user started the conversation with
    the intention of booking a rental car for their upcoming trip to Italy. After
    selecting the dates, the bot provided several car rental options. The user then
    changed their mind and asked the bot to help book a hotel, but the bot informed
    them that it did not have any hotel information in its database for Italy and
    redirected the user back to car rental options. The user then asked for more options
    for rental cars. Therefore, the user''s objective of booking both a rental car
    and a hotel was not fully met.'
